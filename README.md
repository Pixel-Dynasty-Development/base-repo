## 🔧 Customization

This template is ready for your content and ideas.

* **Page Content:** To edit the content of the "Home", "About", or "Contact" pages, simply modify the HTML inside the corresponding `<div id="..." class="page-content">` in `index.html`.
* **Adding New Pages:**
    1.  Add a new link to the navigation bar in the `<header>`.
    2.  Create a new `<div id="your-page-id" class="page-content hidden">...</div>` in the `<main>` section with your new content.
    The JavaScript router will handle the rest!
* **Styling:** You can add custom styles in the `<style>` tag in the `<head>` or leverage the full power of [Tailwind CSS classes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) directly on your HTML elements.
